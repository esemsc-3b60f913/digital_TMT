    "- **Trail-Making-Test Part A**: \n",
    "  - Consists of 25 circles numbered 1–25, distributed over a sheet of paper. \n",
    "  - Subject connects the numbers in ascending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Trail-Making-Test Part B**:\n",
    "  - Includes 25 circles with numbers (1–13) and letters (A–L).\n",
    "  - Subject alternates between numbers and letters in ascending order (e.g., 1-A-2-B-3-C).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Instructions**:\n",
    "  - Connect the circles as quickly as possible without lifting the pen. \n",
    "  - Time the subject and record errors. Errors must be corrected as part of the total timing.\n",
    "  - Total test time: 5 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scoring**:\n",
    "  - **TMT-A**: Average 29s; Deficient >78s (Rule of thumb: 90s).\n",
